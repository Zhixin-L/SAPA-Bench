## 📖SAPA-Bench Overview

Smartphones offer great convenience but also collect vast amounts of personal information.  
With the rise of **MLLM-powered smartphone agents**, automation performance has improved significantly—yet at the cost of **extensive access to sensitive user data**.  

To systematically evaluate this issue, we introduce the **first large-scale benchmark** (7,138 scenarios) for **privacy awareness in smartphone agents**. Each scenario is annotated with:  
- 🔑 **Privacy Type** (e.g., *Account Credentials*)  
- ⚠️ **Sensitivity Level**  
- 📍 **Location**  

We benchmarked **seven mainstream smartphone agents** and found:  
- Overall privacy awareness (RA) remains **below 60%**, even with explicit hints.  
- **Closed-source agents** generally perform better; **Gemini 2.0-flash** achieved the highest RA (67%).  
- Privacy detection strongly correlates with **sensitivity level**—higher sensitivity makes scenarios more identifiable.  

👉 Our results highlight the urgent need to rethink the **utility–privacy tradeoff** in the design of smartphone agents.
